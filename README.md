# MERNShoppingList

Welcome to my MERNShoppingList app! This was a BradTraversyMedia walkthru tutorial which I coded along to. I did this because I wanted experience with using React as a front end framework and it really helped! I used Mongodb, Express, React, and Node (MERN) but also Redux was used as well. Redux was the challenging part for me and before it was introduced into this application I went and watched a few tutorials on what Redux is, how to use Redux, and just tried to wrap my head around it. In the end, setting up Redux is still tricky for me but do-able, I would just need to refer back to the docs (which is never a problem and always very easily accessible) but I definitely do understand the concept and how important its use is with React and larger scale applications. 

I also deployed this project to Heroku: https://damp-hamlet-29615.herokuapp.com/

I really enjoyed making this app and learned a lot! It was good getting practice making a full stack app, setting proxies, using a database, getting stuck with bugs and spending frustating minutes (more like hours) to fix those bugs, React-strap, and of course React.
